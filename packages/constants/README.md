# Constants

## Overview

The `constants` package serves as a centralized repository for application-wide constants. By consolidating constants in one location, this package helps maintain consistency and simplifies updates across the workspace.

## Key Features

- **Centralized Constants**: Contains reusable constants shared across projects.
- **Improved Maintainability**: Simplifies updates and reduces redundancy.
- **Independent Package**: This package has no runtime dependencies, ensuring lightweight usage.

## Constants Categories

The constants are organized into the following categories:

1. **API Endpoints**: URLs for communication with backend services.
2. **Application Settings**: General configuration values used throughout the app.
3. **Error Messages**: Predefined error messages for consistent user feedback.

## Usage

To use these constants in your project, import them as follows:

```javascript
import { API_URL, ERROR_MESSAGES } from '@workspace/constants';

console.log(`API URL: ${API_URL}`);
console.log(`Error Message: ${ERROR_MESSAGES.GENERAL_ERROR}`);
```

## Maintenance

When adding or modifying constants:

- Use clear, descriptive names in **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE**.
- Organize constants into appropriate categories.
- Ensure that changes are documented and reviewed for consistency.

This structure ensures that all projects in the workspace can leverage these constants for streamlined development and improved maintainability.
