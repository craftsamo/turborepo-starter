# Types

## Overview

The `types` package serves as a central repository for shared TypeScript types and interfaces across the workspace. By consolidating type definitions, this package helps maintain consistency and reduces redundancy in type declarations.

## Key Features

- **Shared Types**: Contains reusable TypeScript types and interfaces.
- **Centralized Maintenance**: Simplifies updates and ensures type consistency across projects.
- **Dependency-Free**: No runtime dependencies, purely focused on type management.

## Usage

To use these types in your project, import them as follows:

```typescript
import { SomeType } from '@workspace/types';
```

This setup ensures that all projects in the workspace can leverage the shared types for streamlined development and improved maintainability.
