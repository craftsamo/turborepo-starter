description: Create a pull request ($ARGUMENTS is base branch name)
agent: build
model: github-copilot/gpt-5-mini
---

Pay close attention to the following points, and use the `gh pr create *`
command to create a pull request from the branch given by
!`git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` (the source/head branch) into $ARGUMENTS (the
target/base branch) in the repository shown by
!`gh repo view -q ".owner.login + \"/\" + .name" --json name,owner`.

**Rules**:

1. Run `git log -n 5` to understand the language (e.g., Japanese, English) and
   style used in recent commits. Identify which language is used for commit
   messages and follow it for consistency.
2. If the base branch is not specified, reply with "$ARGUMENTS must be
   specified." and abort.

**Format**:

1. If @.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md or @.github/pull_request_template.md
   exists, complete the content according to that file.
2. If it does not exist, execute `gh pr list --state=closed --limit=3` and
   `gh pr view {pr_number} --json body` to refer to the three most recent Pull
   Requests and determine the most appropriate format.

**Title**:

1. Must summarize the result of `git diff {base_branch}`
2. Must begin with a verb (e.g., Add xx, Fix xx, Enable xx), be within 50
   characters.

**Body**:

1. The body of the Pull Request should be carefully analyzed based on the
   content of `git diff {base_branch}` and written accordingly.
2. If including any of the following content, enclose it within a <details>
   block and set an appropriate <summary> label:
   - Build results
   - Test results
   - System logs
   - Output containing more than 20 lines of data
